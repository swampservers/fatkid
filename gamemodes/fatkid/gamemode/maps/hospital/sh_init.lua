FATKID_BACKSTORY = [[
<p>
It was a normal school day for Gregory, getting dodgeballs thrown at him, and getting shot at in school.
Until... someone threw a dodgeball at his fat stomach and burst his appendix! He had to get to a hospital immediately!
The closest hospital was sadly far away in City 17. Right before his surgery, the skinny kids wanted to come by to visit.
But once Gregory found out about their arrival, HE GOT MAD! He almost ate his doctors!
The entire hospital faculty got scared and fleed, leaving behind barries so that the fat kid couldn't get them.
Now the barriers would just be a problem for the skinny kids to survive...
It's a good thing the Donald Trump approved "Arm our Hospitals" bill was just passed, or else the skinny kids wouldnt stand a chance.
